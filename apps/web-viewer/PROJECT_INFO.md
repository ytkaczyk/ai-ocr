# Next.js + Supabase Project

This project was created from the Next.js + Supabase context engineering template.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Copy Template (Already Done!)**
   ```bash
   # This step is complete - you've already copied the template
   ```

2. **Follow the 3-Step PRP Framework Workflow:**

   **Step 1: Define Your Feature Requirements**
   ```bash
   # Edit PRPs/INITIAL.md with your specific feature requirements
   code PRPs/INITIAL.md
   ```

   **Step 2: Generate Your PRP**
   ```bash
   # Use the specialized Next.js + Supabase PRP generation command
   /generate-nextjs-prp PRPs/INITIAL.md
   ```

   **Step 3: Execute Your PRP**
   ```bash
   # Execute the generated PRP with comprehensive validation
   /execute-nextjs-prp PRPs/your-generated-prp.md
   ```

## 📁 Template Structure

- `CLAUDE.md` - Next.js + Supabase specialized development patterns
- `.claude/commands/` - Specialized PRP generation and execution commands
- `PRPs/templates/` - Base PRP template for Next.js + Supabase features
- `PRPs/INITIAL.md` - Example feature request template
- `examples/` - Working code examples and patterns
- `README.md` - Comprehensive usage guide

## 🎯 What You Can Build

- Full-stack web applications with Next.js App Router
- User authentication and profile management
- Real-time features with Supabase subscriptions
- File upload and storage functionality
- Responsive Material-UI interfaces
- Multi-tenant applications with RLS security
- Dashboard and admin panel interfaces

## 📚 Key Features

- **Next.js 15+ App Router** - Modern React framework with server components
- **Supabase Integration** - PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, real-time
- **Material-UI v7+** - Comprehensive React component library
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety throughout the application
- **Testing** - Vitest, Playwright, Storybook integration
- **Security** - Row Level Security policies and authentication patterns

## 🚫 Common Gotchas

- Always enable RLS policies on database tables
- Use 'use client' directive only when necessary in App Router
- Handle authentication state changes properly
- Clean up real-time subscriptions to prevent memory leaks

## 📖 Next Steps

1. Read through `CLAUDE.md` to understand the specialized patterns
2. Review examples in the `examples/` directory
3. Customize `PRPs/INITIAL.md` with your feature requirements
4. Start building with the PRP workflow!

Happy coding! 🎉
